# Encoding_performance_measure

Based on the Huffman Algorithm used for encoding, this project is an implementation in Python that is used to compare the binary code length of the input provided by the user. The user enters the input, then using the encoding algorithm, each character is assigned a binary code, which may be longer or shorter that its actual binary code, depending on the character's frequency. Each character is then shown with its assigned binary code. In order to see the real difference, the original input is shown alongside the compressed version of the binary code and the original version of the binary code.
